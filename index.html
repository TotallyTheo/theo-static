    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     My name is Theodore Van Wyk, I am a psychology graduate trying to turn software developer.
     I have always had a passion for software development and coding from highschool, but I only now got the change to persue it.
     If I am not working or studying I am doing work on my Podcast that I have on the side.
     My family is really what motivates me to do good in my studies and in everything I do actually. Just being able to make them proud and being
     able to help and support them they way they have supported me, that is my goal. Thats what gets me out of bed in the morning
     Im a coder
     A gamer
     a podcast creater
     and to fund all these things I am a working at heights facilitator by day time.
